/**
 * Build Order:
 * You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of pairs of projects, where the second
 * project is dependent on the first project). All of a project's dependencies must be built before the project is.
 * Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built. If there is no valid build order, return an error.
 EXAMPLE
 Input:
 projects: a, b, c, d, e, f
 dependencies: (a, d), (f, b), (b, d), (f, a), (d, c) Output: f, e, a, b, d, c
